# Key Store

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';


The **Expo Open OTA** server requires several keys and secrets to interact with the Expo API and your CDN.

The **Key store** is a module that manages how these keys are accessed by the server.

You can use 3 different key stores:
1. **Local Key Store**: Keys are stored in a directory on the server as *.pem files.
2. **AWS Secrets Manager**: Keys are stored in AWS Secrets Manager and securely accessed by the server.
3. **Environment Variables**: Keys are stored as environment variables in base64 format.

:::note
The environment variables required for key store configuration are listed below. You can set them in a `.env` file in the root of the project or keep them in a safe place to prepare for deployment.
:::

## Keys

The following keys are used by the server:
1. **Expo signing key pairs**: Used to sign and verify the updates returned by the server to `expo-updates`. The key pair consists of a public and private key and are **required** by the server.
2. **Cloudfront private key**: Used to sign the Cloudfront URLs for the assets. This key is **optional** and only required if you are using Cloudfront as your CDN.

## Expo signing certificate

To generate expo signing key pairs :
1. On your terminal, go to the root directory of your expo project.
2. Run the following command:

```bash title="cd ./my-expo-project"
npx eoas generate-certs
```

Three files will be generated in the `certs` directory:
1. `private-key.pem`: The private key used to sign the updates.
2. `public-key.pem`: The public key used to verify the updates.
Those two keys are used by the server to sign and verify the updates.

3. `certificate.pem`: Used by your expo client to verify the updates. It should be committed to your expo project.

## Cloudfront private key

:::note
This key is only required if you are using Cloudfront as your CDN.
:::
Please refer to this [section](/docs/cdn/cloudfront#generate-key-pair) on how to generate a Cloudfront private key.

## Key Store Configuration

<Tabs queryString="keyStore" defaultValue="environment">
    <TabItem value="environment" label="Environment Variables" default>
    You will have to encode the keys in base64 format and set the following environment variables:

    ```bash title="Encode keys"
    echo -n "your-private-key" | base64
    ```

    Then set the following environment variables:

    ```bash title=".env"
    KEYS_STORAGE_TYPE=environment
    PUBLIC_EXPO_KEY_B64=base64-encoded-public-key
    PRIVATE_EXPO_KEY_B64=base64-encoded-private-key
    PRIVATE_CLOUDFRONT_KEY_B64=base64-encoded-cloudfront-private-key
    ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="aws-secrets-manager" label="AWS Secrets Manager">
    :::note
    If you are not familiar with AWS Secrets Manager, you can refer to the [official documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/intro.html).
    :::

    1. Create a secret for each keys in AWS Secrets Manager.
    2. Set the following environment variables:

    ```bash title=".env"
    KEYS_STORAGE_TYPE=aws-secrets-manager
    AWS_KEYS_PRIVATE_EXPO_KEY_SECRET_ID=The secret name of the expo private key
    AWS_KEYS_PUBLIC_EXPO_KEY_SECRET_ID=The secret name of the expo public key
    AWSSM_CLOUDFRONT_PRIVATE_KEY_SECRET_ID=The secret name of the cloudfront private key
    AWS_REGION=your-region
    ```

    If your are not using AWS IAM roles, you also need to set the following environment variables:
    ```bash title=".env"
    AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-access-key-id
    AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-secret-access-key
    ```

    :::info
        The server use the same AWS credentials for [S3 Storage](/docs/storage?storage=s3) and AWS Secrets Manager. Please ensure to setup the correct ACLs and permissions for the keys.
    :::
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="local" label="Local Key Store">
    :::warning
    This key store is not recommended for production use. It is intended for development and testing purposes only.
    :::

    To use local key store you will need to set the following environment variables:

    ```bash title=".env"
    KEYS_STORAGE_TYPE=local
    PUBLIC_LOCAL_EXPO_KEY_PATH=/path/to/public-key.pem
    PRIVATE_LOCAL_EXPO_KEY_PATH=/path/to/private-key.pem
    PRIVATE_LOCAL_CLOUDFRONT_KEY_PATH=/path/to/cloudfront-private-key.pem
    ```

    </TabItem>
</Tabs>
