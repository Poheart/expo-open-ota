# Publish an update

To publish an update, run the following command in your Expo project:

```bash
npx eoas publish --branch <branch-name> --channel <release-channel>
```

This command will retrieve the expo credentials on your .expo/state.json file or an EXPO_TOKEN in your runtime environment to authentify
the request to the Expo API.


## CI/CD

You can automate the process of publishing updates by integrating the `npx eoas publish` command in your CI/CD pipeline.
But you need to make sure that the EXPO_TOKEN is setup in your CI/CD environment.
