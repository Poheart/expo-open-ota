# Update publishing

## Runtime version

EOAS uses official Expo packages to resolve the runtime version of your project.
It supports the fingerprint policy.

## Publish an update

To publish an update, run the following command in your Expo project:

```bash
npx eoas publish --branch <branch-name> --channel <release-channel>
```

This command will retrieve the expo credentials from your .expo/state.json file or an EXPO_TOKEN in your runtime environment to authenticate
the request to the Expo API.


## CI/CD

You can automate the process of publishing updates by integrating the `npx eoas publish --nonInteractive` command in your CI/CD pipeline.
However, you need to make sure that the EXPO_TOKEN is set up in your CI/CD environment.
(Do not forget the `--nonInteractive` flag to avoid interactive prompts)
