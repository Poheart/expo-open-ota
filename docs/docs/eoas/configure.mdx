# Configure your Expo Project

## Prerequisites
A running and deployed **Expo Open OTA** server is required to configure your Expo project. If you haven't deployed the server yet, follow the [deployment guide](/docs/category/deployment) to get started.
You also need to have your expo signing certificate ready. If you haven't generated one yet, follow the [generate signing certificate](/docs/key-store#expo-signing-certificate) guide.

## Initialize your Expo project with Expo Open OTA

Run the following command in your Expo project to initialize the project for OTA updates.

```bash
npx eoas init
```

And follow the instructions.

After running the command, the app.config.js file will be updated with the necessary configuration for OTA updates.

## Create a new build

A new build of your application must be submitted. This ensures that the new configuration is applied to the app.
You can follow this [EAS Guide](https://docs.expo.dev/build/introduction/) to create a new build.
