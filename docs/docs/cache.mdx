# Caching

The **Expo Open OTA server** uses a cache to improve performance and reduce server load by avoiding repeated computations.

## Cache Usage

The cache is primarily used for:

1. **Storing the computed `lastUpdateId` for a given platform and runtime version**
   - This prevents the need to recompute the last update for every request, significantly speeding up responses.

2. **Caching the computed manifest**
   - Manifest generation can be an expensive operation.
   - By caching the results, we reduce response times and improve overall performance.

## Current Limitations

Currently, the cache is **local** to the server instance. This means:

- When a new update is published, the first request for the manifest may take longer as the cache needs to be repopulated.
- The cache is not shared across multiple instances, which could lead to inconsistent results in a distributed setup.

## Future Improvements

We plan to implement a **distributed caching system**, such as Redis, to:

- Share cached results across multiple instances.
- Ensure consistent and faster responses regardless of the server handling the request.

Once the distributed cache is in place, performance will be significantly improved, especially for high-traffic environments.
