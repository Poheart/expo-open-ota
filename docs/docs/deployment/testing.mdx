# Local testing
If you want to test **Expo Open OTA** locally, you can use the provided docker-compose file to run the server locally
and expose it on internet using reverse proxy like ngrok.

## Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/axelmarciano/expo-open-ota
cd expo-open-ota
```

## Setup .env

Setup [environment variables](/docs/environment) by creating a `.env` file in the root directory of the project.

## Run the server using docker-compose
```bash
docker-compose build
docker-compose up
```

The server is now running on port **3000**.

## Expose with ngrok (optional)

You can use ngrok to expose the server to the internet. Install ngrok and run
```bash
ngrok http 3000
```

Modify the `BASE_URL` environment variable in the `.env` file to the ngrok URL.
