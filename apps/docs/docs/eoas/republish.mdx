# Republish

The `republish` command lets you resend an existing update to a specified branch and platform. It walks you through selecting the runtime version and the exact update to republish.

## Usage

```bash
npx eoas republish --branch <branch-name> [--platform <platform>]
```

## Options

- `--branch <branch-name>`: Name of the branch to which the update will be republished.
- `--platform <platform>`: Platform to which the update will be republished. If not specified, all platforms will be used.

## Description

Republishing reuses the same code and assets from a previous update, assigning them a new update ID on the target branch and platform. Use it to reâ€‘trigger deployments, recover from collisions, or reapply a past release.
