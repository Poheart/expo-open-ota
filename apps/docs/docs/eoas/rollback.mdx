# Rollback

The `rollback` command allows you to publish a rollback update to a specific branch and runtime version.

⚠️ Not compatible with `disableAntiBrickingMeasure`, as expo-updates will ignore embedded updates in that case.

## Usage

Specify the branch and target runtime version to perform a rollback:
```bash
npx eoas rollback --branch <branch-name> [--platform <platform>]
```

## Description

A rollback update reverts the application on the specified branch to the embedded update without requiring a new native build.
