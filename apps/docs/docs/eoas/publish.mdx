# Update publishing

## Runtime version

EOAS uses official Expo packages to resolve the runtime version of your project.
It supports the fingerprint policy.

## Publish an update

To publish an update, run the following command in your Expo project:

```bash
npx eoas publish --branch <branch-name> [--nonInteractive] [--outputDir <outputDir>] [--platform <platform>]
```

This command will retrieve the expo credentials from your .expo/state.json file or an EXPO_TOKEN in your runtime environment to authenticate
the request to the Expo API.

:::warning
 ðŸš¨EOAS publish will create a new build of your app. Do not forget to pass the necessary environment variables to the runtime environment.
 Example: `EXPO_TOKEN=your_token RELEASE_CHANNEL=staging npx eoas publish --branch <branch-name>`.
 Or with dotenv: `dotenv -e .env.local -- npx eoas publish --branch <branch-name>`.
:::

## CI/CD

You can automate the process of publishing updates by integrating the `npx eoas publish --nonInteractive` command in your CI/CD pipeline.
However, you need to make sure that the EXPO_TOKEN is set up in your CI/CD environment.
(Do not forget the `--nonInteractive` flag to avoid interactive prompts)
