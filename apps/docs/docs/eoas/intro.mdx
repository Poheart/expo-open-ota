# EOAS

EOAS (**Expo Open Application Service**) is an npm package maintained by the **Expo Open OTA** project.

## Purpose

EOAS is designed to simplify the setup and management of projects using **Expo Open OTA**. It provides a streamlined way to configure the project and handle update publications efficiently.

## Features

### **Project Configuration**
EOAS helps automate essential setup steps, including:

- **Generating the certificate for code signing**
  - Ensures that updates are properly signed and verified before being delivered to end-users.
- **Configuring `app.config.js`**
  - Automatically updates the Expo configuration to point to the correct **Expo Open OTA server**, ensuring that published updates are fetched correctly.
- **Leveraging existing Expo logic**
  - EOAS relies heavily on Expo’s built-in mechanisms for calculating the project configuration and generating fingerprints.
  - This ensures consistency with Expo’s ecosystem and avoids redundant logic, making integration seamless.

### **Update Management**
EOAS provides commands to publish updates either:
- **Locally**, from a developer’s machine.
- **From CI/CD pipelines**, ensuring automated and consistent update deployment.

### **Authentication with EAS Credentials**
- EOAS uses **Expo Application Services (EAS) credentials** to authenticate update publications on the **Expo Open OTA server**.
- This ensures that only authorized users and CI/CD environments can publish updates, enhancing security and control.
